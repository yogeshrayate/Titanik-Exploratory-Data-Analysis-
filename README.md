# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
The Titanic Data Analysis project focuses on exploring and analyzing passenger data from the Titanic disaster to identify key factors that influenced survival.  
This project uses **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover patterns and insights using Python.
---
## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source:** Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- **Rows:** 891 passengers
- **Columns:** 12 features
### Key Features
- `Survived` – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass` – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `Sex` – Gender
- `Age` – Passenger age
- `SibSp` – Siblings/Spouses onboard
- `Parch` – Parents/Children onboard
- `Fare` – Ticket fare
- `Embarked` – Port of embarkation

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
The following analyses were performed:
- Survival count distribution  
- Survival by gender  
- Survival by passenger class  
- Age distribution analysis  
- Fare vs survival comparison  
---
## 🧠 Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males  
- Passengers in **1st class** survived more than others  
- Children had better chances of survival  
- Higher ticket fare increased survival probability  
---
## 📊 Visualizations Used
- Count plots  
- Bar charts  
- Box plots  
---
## ✅ Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis revealed that **gender, passenger class, and age** were the most important factors influencing survival.  
The Titanic dataset is excellent for beginners to practice data analysis and visualization skills.
